            Big data is a term used to describe extremely large sets of data
            that can be analyzed to reveal patterns, trends, and associations.
            With the explosion of digital information in recent years, big data
            has become increasingly prevalent in virtually every aspect of
            modern society, from business and government to healthcare and
            education. One of the key characteristics of big data is its size.
            Traditional data management tools and methods are often inadequate
            for dealing with the massive amounts of data generated by modern
            technology. Big data requires sophisticated tools and techniques for
            data storage, retrieval, and analysis, including distributed
            computing, data mining, and machine learning. Another important
            characteristic of big data is its diversity. Big data comes from a
            wide range of sources, including social media, mobile devices,
            sensors, and other digital technologies. This diverse range of data
            types presents unique challenges for data analysis, as different
            types of data require different analytical methods. Despite the
            challenges, big data has the potential to transform virtually every
            industry. In the business world, big data can be used to gain
            insights into consumer behavior and preferences, enabling companies
            to make better decisions about product development, marketing, and
            customer service. In healthcare, big data can be used to develop
            personalized treatment plans based on individual patient data,
            improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Big data
            can also be used to address some of the world's most pressing
            problems. For example, big data can be used to predict and prevent
            natural disasters, improve urban planning and transportation
            systems, and monitor and respond to climate change. However, there
            are also concerns about the ethical implications of big data. The
            collection and analysis of large amounts of data can raise privacy
            concerns, as individuals may not be aware of the data that is being
            collected about them or how it is being used. There are also
            concerns about the potential for bias in big data analysis, which
            could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. In conclusion, big
            data has the potential to transform virtually every aspect of modern
            society, from business and healthcare to education and social
            policy. However, the challenges of managing and analyzing large and
            diverse sets of data must be addressed, and ethical considerations
            must be taken into account to ensure that the benefits of big data
            are realized in a responsible and ethical manner.

            In today’s world, Big Data analytics is fueling everything we do online—in every industry.

            Take the music streaming platform Spotify for example. The company has nearly 96 million users that generate a tremendous amount of data every day. Through this information, the cloud-based platform automatically generates suggested songs—through a smart recommendation engine—based on likes, shares, search history, and more. What enables this is the techniques, tools, and frameworks that are a result of Big Data analytics.

            If you are a Spotify user, then you must have come across the top recommendation section, which is based on your likes, past history, and other things. Utilizing a recommendation engine that leverages data filtering tools that collect data and then filter it using algorithms works. This is what Spotify does.

            But, let’s get back to the basics first.

            Big Data is a massive amount of data sets that cannot be stored, processed, or analyzed using traditional tools. 

            Today, there are millions of data sources that generate data at a very rapid rate. These data sources are present across the world. Some of the largest sources of data are social media platforms and networks. Let’s use Facebook as an example—it generates more than 500 terabytes of data every day. This data includes pictures, videos, messages, and more. 

            Data also exists in different formats, like structured data, semi-structured data, and unstructured data. For example, in a regular Excel sheet, data is classified as structured data—with a definite format. In contrast, emails fall under semi-structured, and your pictures and videos fall under unstructured data. All this data combined makes up Big Data. 

            Let’s look into the four advantages of Big Data analytics.

            The history of Big Data analytics can be traced back to the early days of computing, when organizations first began using computers to store and analyze large amounts of data. However, it was not until the late 1990s and early 2000s that Big Data analytics really began to take off, as organizations increasingly turned to computers to help them make sense of the rapidly growing volumes of data being generated by their businesses.

            Today, Big Data analytics has become an essential tool for organizations of all sizes across a wide range of industries. By harnessing the power of Big Data, organizations are able to gain insights into their customers, their businesses, and the world around them that were simply not possible before.

            As the field of Big Data analytics continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more amazing and transformative applications of this technology in the years to come.

            <h5>1. Risk Management </h5>
                Use Case: Banco de Oro, a Phillippine banking company, uses Big Data analytics to identify fraudulent activities and discrepancies. The organization leverages it to narrow down a list of suspects or root causes of problems. 
            <h5>2. Product Development and Innovations
            </h5>
                Use Case: Rolls-Royce, one of the largest manufacturers of jet engines for airlines and armed forces across the globe, uses Big Data analytics to analyze how efficient the engine designs are and if there is any need for improvements. 
            <h5>3. Quicker and Better Decision Making Within Organizations
            </h5>
                Use Case: Starbucks uses Big Data analytics to make strategic decisions. For example, the company leverages it to decide if a particular location would be suitable for a new outlet or not. They will analyze several different factors, such as population, demographics, accessibility of the location, and more.
            <h5>4. Improve Customer Experience
            </h5>
                 Use Case: Delta Air Lines uses Big Data analysis to improve customer experiences. They monitor tweets to find out their customers’ experience regarding their journeys, delays, and so on. The airline identifies negative tweets and does what’s necessary to remedy the situation. By publicly addressing these issues and offering solutions, it helps the airline build good customer relations.

            Now, let’s review how Big Data analytics works:
            Stage 1 - Business case evaluation - The Big Data analytics lifecycle begins with a business case, which defines the reason and goal behind the analysis.
            Stage 2 - Identification of data - Here, a broad variety of data sources are identified.
            Stage 3 - Data filtering - All of the identified data from the previous stage is filtered here to remove corrupt data.
            Stage 4 - Data extraction - Data that is not compatible with the tool is extracted and then transformed into a compatible form.
            Stage 5 - Data aggregation - In this stage, data with the same fields across different datasets are integrated.
            Stage 6 - Data analysis - Data is evaluated using analytical and statistical tools to discover useful information.
            Stage 7 - Visualization of data - With tools like Tableau, Power BI, and QlikView, Big Data analysts can produce graphic visualizations of the analysis.
            Stage 8 - Final analysis result - This is the last step of the Big Data analytics lifecycle, where the final results of the analysis are made available to business stakeholders who will take action.
